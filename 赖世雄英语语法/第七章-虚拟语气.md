## 第七章 虚拟语气

虚拟语气（the subjunctive mood）是一种表示假设状态的句型，由if引导的状语从句与主句构成。依时态的不同而形成下列四种基本句型

a. 纯条件的虚拟语气

b. 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气

c. 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气

d. 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气

四种代表性的例句如下：

a. 纯条件的虚拟语气——用现在时

eg. If he is here, I will beat him.

b. 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气——用过去时

eg. If he were here, I would beat him.(but he is not here)

c. 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气——用过去完成时

eg. If he had been here, I would have beaten him.(but he was not here)

d. 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气——if从句要用助动词should，译成万一，主句则用过去时或现在时助动词

eg. If he should be here, I would beat him.



### 第一节、纯条件虚拟语气

#### 1.基本句型

使用纯条件虚拟语气时，if从句的动词用现在时，主句则是现在时助动词加上动词原形。

句型如下：

If + 主语 + 一般现在时动词， 主语 + will\may\can\should\shall\must\ought to + 原形动词

eg. If he is here, I will beat him.



#### 2.使用时机及要点

a. 纯条件虚拟语气的if从句中，时态为一般现在时，表示若if的条件存在，就会有预期的结果。

b. 表纯条件结构的副词连词不只if一种。once一旦、when当、before在...之前、as soon as一旦、unless除非等副词连词亦可构成条件句，其用法与if相同

eg. Once I have money, I will buy a car.

c. 通常助动词不置于if从句中，只置于主句中

eg. If the news will be true, he may be safe. -F

=If the news is true, he may be safe.

但if从句的主语为人时，可用can、will、must等助动词

eg. If he will do it, I will be happy.

= If he is willing to do it, I will be happy.

d. 我们已知纯条件虚拟语气的主句中，助动词均用一般现在时，但should为唯一例外。因为should表示应当之意，等于ought to，故不受限制

eg. If I have time, I should\ought to do it.



### 第二节、与现在事实相反的虚拟语气

#### 1.基本句型

If + 主语 + 一般过去时动词， 主语 + would\could\might\should\ought to + 原形动词

eg. If I were rich, I would help you.



#### 2.使用时机及要点

a. 本虚拟语气旨在表示与现在事实相反的情况。一见到此类一般过去时句型出现时，可确知事实并非如此。

eg. If I were rich, I would help you.

= As I am not rich, I can't help you.

b. 不论主语为第几人称，if从句中的be动词，均使用were

eg. If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

If I was you, I wouldn't do it. -F If I were you, I woudn't do it. -T

c. 主句中的助动词一定为过去时助动词

will-would、may-might、can-could、shall-should、ought to 。但Must只能表示现在或将来的状况，故只用于纯条件的虚拟语气，而绝不可用于现在事实或过去事实相反的虚拟语气中。

eg. If you did it for me, I would be very happy.



### 第三节、与过去事实相反的虚拟语气

#### 1.基本句型

本虚拟语气中，if从句的动词要用过去完成时，主句则是助动词的过去时再加上have + 过去分词，句型如下

If + 主语 + had + p.p, 主语 + would\could\might\should\ought to + have + p.p.

eg. If I had arrived earlier, I could have met him.要是当时我早点到，就可以见到他了。



#### 2.使用时机及要点

a. 本虚拟语气旨在表示与过去事实相反的情况。换言之，一见到此类过去完成时的句型出现时，我们就确知当时的事实并非如此。

eg. If I had arrived earlier, I could have met him. 要是当时我早点到，就可以见到他了。

= As I didn't arrive earlier, I didn't meet him.

b. 注意if从句中had与had had的区别

1）在if + 主语 + had + 名词的结构中，had为一般过去时动词，译成有，此为表示与现在事实相反的虚拟语气。主句中置一般过去时的助动词即可。

eg. If he had(vt.) money(n.), he would buy a car.如果他现在有钱，就会买车了

2）在if + 主语 + had + 过去分词的结构中，had为过去完成时助动词，译成曾经或已经，之后置过去分词，此时为表与过去事实相反的虚拟语气。主句使用过去时助动词 + have + 过去分词

eg. If he had(助动词) had(p.p.) money, he would have bought a car. 如果他当时有钱的话，就会买车了



### 第四节、与将来状况相反的虚拟语气

基本句型及要点：

使用本虚拟语气时，If从句一定要加助动词should，if...should译成万一。若假设的可能性很低，则主句要置过去时助动词（和与现在事实相反的虚拟语气相同），但若假设的可能性很高，则主句要用现在时助动词（与纯条件虚拟语气相同）

a. 低可能性

If + 主语 + should + 原形 V， 主语 would\could\might\should\ought to + 原形 V

eg. If you should fall ill, the meeting would be put off.万一你生病，会议将延期——你不太可能生病，会议不太可能延期

b. If + 主语 + should + 原形 V， 主语 + will\can\may\should\ought to + 原形 V

eg. If it should rain, I will stay home. 万一下雨，我就会待在家里——可能会下雨，果真如此，我会待在家里

注意：表示与将来状况相反的虚拟语气，亦可与祈使句形成的主句连用

eg. If I should be late, be sure to wait for me. 万一我迟到，务必要等我。——我可能会迟到，你务必要等我。



### 第五节、使用虚拟语气应注意事项

#### 1.表示强烈与真理相反的虚拟语气句型

If + 主语 + were to + 原形 V， 主语 + would\could\might\should\ought to + 原形 V

eg. 真理：The cat can't smile.

​      假设：If the cat were to smile, I would pass out.



#### 2.if的省略

虚拟语气的if从句，若有过去完成时助动词had，或表万一的助动词should或是were出现时，可将这些词类置于主语前，而将if省略

a. had

eg. If he had done it, he would have felt sorry.

= Had he done it, he would have felt sorry. 如果他当时做了这件事，他会后悔的。

b. should

eg. If he should tell lies, I would punish him.

= Should he tell lies, I would punish him.

c. were

eg. If he were lazy, he might fail.

= Were he lazy, he might fail. 如果他懒惰，就可能会失败。



#### 3.时态不一致的假设

也就是if从句与过去事实相反，用过去完成时，主句与现在事实相反，则置助动词过去时。句型如下：

If + 主语 + had + p.p., 主语 + would\could\might\should\ought to + 原形V + now\today

eg. If I had started saving then, I would have been able to buy a car now. -F

If I had started saving then, I would be able to buy a car now. -T

If I had met her five years ago, she might be my wife today. -T



#### 4.可取代if的其他连词

if = in case that、on condition that、provided that、so long as只要、as long as只要，此类连词通常只用在表纯条件的虚拟语气中。换言之，其引导的从句时态均为一般现在时。

eg. If it is fine, we will start to do it.

In case he comes, let me know.

= In case he should come, let me know.

注意：in case  + that从句 万一... in case of + 名词 万一...

eg. In case an accident happens, don't panic.

= In case of an accident, don't panic. 万一有意外发生，不要惊慌。



#### 5.but for... 若非/要不是...

仅限于与现在事实及过去事实相反的虚拟语气

a. 与现在事实相反：若非，就

If it were not + that从句（一般现在时 + 主语 + could\would\might\should\ought to + 原形V

= But for + 名词 + for + 名词，+主语 + could\would\might\should\ought to + 原形V

eg. If it were not that he works hard, I wouldn't like him.

= If it were not for his hard work, I...

= Were it not for his hard work, I...

= But for his hard work, I...

b. 与过去事实相反：若非当时...就...

If it had not been that从句（一般过去时）， + 主语 + would\could\might\should \ought to + have + p.p

= But for + 名词，主语 + would\could\might\should\ought to  + have + p.p.

eg. If it had not been that he lent(一般过去时动词) me the money, I could not have bought that book.

= If it had not been for the money which he lent me, I...

= Had it not been for the money which he lent me, I...

= But for the money which he lent me, I...

注意

but for亦可用介词without代替，之后仍接名词

eg. But for his help, I couldn't have done it.

= Without his help, I couldn't have done it. 若非他的帮忙，我无法办这事。



#### 6.lest...should... 以免

lest为副词连词，引导状语从句。在该从句中，助动词一律用should。而should往往予以省略，故该从句中的动词必定是原形动词。

eg. I got up early lest I (should) miss the train.我早起以免错过火车

I arrived on time lest he (should) be angry.我准时到达，免得他生气

注意

lest...should...

= for fear that + 主语 + | may + 原形V（表现在或将来的状况）might + 原形 V（表过去的状况）

eg. You must study hard lest you should fail the exam.

 = You must study hard for fear that you may fail the exam.

 = You must study hard for fear of failing the exam. 你必须努力学习，以免考试不及格

He did it carefully lest he should make the same mistake again.

= He did it carefully for fear that he might make the same mistake again.

= He did it carefully for fear of making the same mistake again.



#### 7.as if... = as though... 仿佛

as if 或 as though均为副词连词，引导状语从句，使用时有三种时态：

a. 表极大的可能，动词使用一般时态

eg. It looks as if it is going to rain.

b. 表与现在事实相反，动词使用一般过去时

eg. Mr. Wang loves me as if I were his own child.

c. 表与过去事实相反， 动词使用过去完成时

eg. He looked as if nothing had happened.

注意，as if 或 as though之后亦可接不定式短语，表示即将发生的状况

eg. She opened her lips as if (she was going) to speak. 



#### 8.What if... should...? 要是...的话会怎样/要怎么办

eg. What if he should come?

= What might happen if he should come?

= What Could I do if he should come?

what if之后亦可用一般现在时

eg. What if he comes?

= What shall we do if he come?



#### 9.It is time + that从句的一般过去时

It is time/about time/high time + that从句的一般过去时 该是...的时候了

使用本句型时，that从句的动词要用一般过去时

eg. It is time that he went to bed.



#### 10.If only 要是...就好了

本句型只用于与现在事实或过去事实相反的虚拟语气中，本句型的时态只能用一般过去时或过去完成时。

eg. If only he were here.

 = I wish he were here.

If only I had known it earlier.

= I wish I had known it earlier.



#### 11.wish的用法

a. wish之后接that从句时，一定要使用虚拟语气。若与现在事实相反，要用一般过去时；若与过去事实相反，则要用过去完成时，that从句中的时态绝无一般现在时。

eg. I wish that he is here. -F

= I wish he were here. -T

= It's too bad he is not here. 我真希望他现在就在这里。但遗憾的是，他并不在这里。

I wish he had been here. -T

= It's too bad that he was not here. 我真希望他当时就在这里。但遗憾的是，他当时并不在这里。

b. I wish that... 真希望...就好了

= I would rather that...

= Would that... 罕见

eg. I wish I had studied harder when young.

= I would rather I had studied harder when young.

= Would that I had studied harder when young.



#### 12.hope的用法

hope之后接that从句，使用一般时态，表示极大的可能性。即表示现在的状况时用现在时，表示将来的状况用将来时，表示完成的状况时用完成时，表示进行的状况时用现在时。

a. 表示现在的状况

eg. I hope that he is safe.

b. 表示将来的状况

eg. I hope he will be back.

c. 表示进行的状况

eg. I hope they are having a good time.

d. 表示完成的状况

eg. I hope they have finished the work.



#### 13.I hope与祈使句的关系

I hope接that从句，从句中可使用助动词may，形成祈使句。此时将I hope that删除，将may 置于原that从句的主语之前，动词仍用原形动词，原句号改为感叹号

eg. I hope that he may live long.

= May he live long!



#### 14.wish和hope的异同

a. 相同部分

* 1）均可用不定式作宾语

* eg. I wish to travel abroad.
* = I hope to travel abroad.
* 2）亦可作不及物动词，与介词for连用，表期望获得之意，以名词作其宾语
* eg. I wish for a chance to try it.
*    = I hope for a chance to try it. 罕见
* I wish\hope a chance to try it. -F

b. 不同部分

表祝福时，只能使用wish，之后接两个名词或代词作其宾语

eg. I wish you a good time.

I hope that you may have a good time. -T

I hope you a good time. -F



#### 15.对过去事物的猜测的三种句型：

a. must have + 过去分词 一定曾经

eg. He is learned; he must have received a good education.

b. may have + 过去分词 可能曾经

eg. He looks tired; he may have stayed up lated last night.

c. cannot have + 过去分词 不可能曾经...

eg. He is honest; he cannot have stolen Mary's money.

若表猜测的结构为疑问句时，要用Can have ?句型

eg. May he have done it? -F

Can he have done it? -T



#### 16.didn't need to + 原形 V 与need not have to + p.p.的区别

didn't need to + 原形 V乃表示过去的事实，即不必...的同时亦没有如此做, 而need not have + p.p. 乃表示与过去事实相反的虚拟语气，即不必...但却这么做了

eg. As I had enough money, I didn't need to borrow any from him.由于钱够，我当时不必向他借钱---同时我也没借

Since you had enough money, you needn't have borrowed money from me. 既然你的钱够用，你原本不必向我借贷，但为什么你还是借了些钱呢？



#### 17.意志动词

意志动词有建议、要求、命令、规定、主张五大类。之后用that 从句作宾语时，that从句中要使用助动词should，而should往往予以省略

a. 建议： suggest、recommend、advise、urge呼吁、propose、move提议

b. 要求：ask、desire、demand、require、request、insist

c. 命令：order、command

d. 规定：rule、regulate、stipulate

e. 主张：advocate、maintain



#### 18.suggest、insist、maintain的另类用法

suggest若表示暗示、insist若表示坚信、maintain若表示坚决认为时，则之后的that从句用一般时态

eg. His words suggested\implied\hinted that he wasn't telling a lie. 他的话中暗示他绝不是在说谎



#### 19.insist on + 名词 坚决要...

eg. He insisted on doing it that way.

insist on 坚持要（有固执的含义）

persist in 从事...很执着（有很努力且不轻易放弃的含义）

eg. John insisted on going fishing even though a typhon was coming.

Peter persisted in handling the problem all by himself.



#### 20.表示有必要的形容词与that从句的关系

表示有必要的形容词，修饰that从句时，该从句亦须使用助动词should，而should往往予以省略。

此类动词通常有八个：

necessary、important、essential、imperative有绝对必要的、urgent紧急的、desirable、recommendable值得推荐的、advisable明智的

eg. It is necessary that he (should) work hard.



#### 21.that从句作同位语

that从句若是置于意志动词变成的名词之后，而与该名词形成同位语时，that从句中也要使用助动词should，而should往往予以省略

eg. It is my suggestion that he (should) study abroad.
