## 第三章 关系词
### 概说

关系词一共分为下列几种：

关系代词、关系代词所有格、关系副词、关系指示代词、复合关系代词、复合关系副词、准关系代词

### 第一节、关系代词

#### 1.关系代词引导定于从句

关系代词有连词的功能，用以引导定语从句

eg. He is a man who always means what he says(关系代词who引导的定语从句).

That's the book which I like.(关系代词which引导的定语从句)

He works hard, which is a fact that we all know(关系代词which).



#### 2.关系代词的种类及其功能

a.代替人时，主格用who（在所引导的定语从句中作主语），宾格用whom（在所引导的定语从句中作宾语）

b.代替事物时，主格或宾格均用which

c.代替整个句子时，主格或宾格均用which

| 关系代词     | 主格  | 宾格  |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| 代替人       | who   | whom  |
| 代替事物     | which | which |
| 代替整个句子 | which | which |



#### 3.关系代词使用三原则

a. 关系代词之前要有先行词（即表人或事物的名词）

b. 关系代词在所引导的定语从句中要作主语、宾语、或表语

c. 否则关系代词之前一定要有介词

eg. He is a man whom I enjoy working. -F

He is a man with whom I enjoy working. -T



#### 4.介词与关系代词

关系代词之前有介词时，介词可移至所引导的定语从句句尾，此时可省略关系代词

eg. He is a man with whom I enjoy working.

= He is a man whom I enjoy working with.

= He is a man I enjoy working with.

The house in which we live is very large.

= The house which we live in is very large.

= The house we live in is very large.



#### 5.which 可代表之前的整个主句

关系代词which若用以代替整个句子时，which之前一定要有逗号。

eg. John, who was lazy, scored quite high marks on the exam, which somewhat surprised me.



#### 6.which亦可代表前句中的部分概念

eg. He smokes three packs of cigarettes a day, which definitely does harm to his health.



#### 7.限制性定语从句与非限制性定语从句的区别

a.非限制性定语从句

先行词为专有名词及独一性名词，之后若接关系代词所引导的定语从句时，该关系代词之前一定要置逗号。此时该定语从句就称为非限制性定语从句。换言之，专有名词或独一性名词本身就具有特殊性，不必再用定语从句加以限定。

eg. He has just come back from New York, which is a very big city in the United States.

b.限制性定语从句

先行词为一般名词且本身并未具特殊性，可用定语从句加以限制，以加强其特殊性。限制性定语从句，将之译成...的，其关系代词前不置逗号。翻译时，先译定语从句，再译先行词。

eg. He is a boy who works hard

但若一般名词之前已有形容词加以修饰而具有特殊性，或该名词本身就具有特殊性，该名词之后的定语从句，使用限制性定语从句或非限制性从句均可。

eg. He is a good boy who studies hard（限制性定语从句）.他是个用功的好孩子

He is a good boy, who studies hard（非限制性定语从句）.他是个好孩子，很用功

I like that good book which he bought yesterday.(限制性定语从句) 我喜欢他昨天买的那本好书

I like that good book, which he bought(非限制性定语从句) 我喜欢那本好书，那是他昨天买的



#### 8.关系代词的省略

限制性（即关系代词之前无逗号）定语从句中，若关系代词为及物动词的宾语，则该关系代词可省略。若关系代词为介词的宾语，介词移至定语从句的句尾时，该关系代词亦可省略。

eg. This is the boy whom(o.) I saw(v.t.) yesterday.

= This is the boy I saw yesterday.

I enjoy reading the book which(o.) I bought(v.t.) yesterday.

= I enjoy reading the book I bought yesterday.



#### 9.that亦可作关系代词

that亦可作关系代词，取代who、whom、which，但使用时有两个条件：

a. that之前不准有逗号，换言之，that仅出现在限制性定语从句中。

b. that之前亦不可有介词

eg. I like the girl who\that is sitting there. -T

This is the knife with that he killed Mary. -F

= This is the knife with which hekilled Mary. -T

= This is the knife which\that he killed Mary with(prep.). -T



#### 10.只能用that的情况

在下列情况中，只能用that作关系代词，绝不可使用which、who、whom

a.序数词后

eg. Gambling is the last thing which I would do. -F

= Gambling is the last thing that I would do. -T

b.最高级后

eg. He is the best student whom I've ever taught. -F

He is the best student that I've ever taught. -T

c.the very + 名词中的very为形容词，是一种强调用法，之前一定置定冠词the。very不必译出。

eg. He is the very man that I met yesterday.

= He is just the man I met yesterday.

d.all之后

eg. All that he said is true.（勿用which取代that）

= Everything that he said is true.

e.the only + 名词之后

eg. He is the only friend that I have.

f.句中若有两个相同关系代词引导的定语从句出现时，为避免重复，第二个关系代词通常用that取代

eg.He works hard, which is a fact which is known to us. -F

He works hard, which is a fact that is known to us. -T

g.关系代词若在be动词后作表语，表示某人的身份时，要使用that，不可使用who或which

eg. He is not the man who he once was. -F

He is not the man that he once was. -T

h.两个名词性质不一，但却共用一个关系代词时，该关系代词要用that取代

eg. Look at the boy and the dog that are coming this way.

i.在下列句中，宜用that取代who或which，以避免与疑问词重复：

eg. Who lies can win our trust? -F	

Who that lies can win our trust? -T

What is it which you want? -F

What is it that you want? -T



#### 11.限制性定语从句可化简为分词短语

限制性定语从句中，若关系代词为主语时，该定语从句可化简为分词短语。法则如下：

a.删除该关系代词；

b.之后的动词变成现在分词

c.若动词为be动词，变成现在分词being之后，可将being省略

eg. The girl who danced here yesterday is my sister.

The girl dancing here yesterday is my sister.

Who is that boy that is standing over there.

Who is that boy being standing over there.



#### 12.非限制性定语从句不能化简为分词短语

eg. I met John, who said that he loved Mary very much. -T

I met John, saying that he loved Mary very much. -F



#### 13.非限制性定语从句可化简为先行词的同位语

who\which + be + n.

此时可就化简为先行词的同位语，即

a. 删除who或which

b.之后的be动词变成现在分词being

c.再将being省略，形成同位语

eg. I met John, who is a good friend of mine.

I met John, a good friend of mine.

He works hard, which is a fact that is known to all of us.

He works hard, a fact known to all of us.



#### 14.注意定语从句与插入语的关系：

定语从句中的关系词不受插入语的影响。

a. 插入语的形成方式：主语 + 表认知的动词，如

I believe|I think|I feel|I know|I consider|I find

b.定语从句置入插入语的方法：

1）先造一个含有限制性从句的定语从句

eg. He is a man who never break his word.

He is the man whom I met yesterday.

2) 再将插入语置于关系词之后

eg. He is a man who(S) I think（插入语） never breaks his word.

c. think、believe、feel、consider、find等动词可作为完全及物动词或不完全及物动词

eg. I think\find\believe that he is nice.(名词性从句)

= I think\find\believe him to be nice.(宾语补语)

注意:

此类动词再who + be + 表语 的定语从句中有两种句型变化

1) 作完全及物动词时，此类动词属于插入语

eg. He is a man who I think is nice. -T

2) 作不完全及物动词时，此类动词不再是插入语

eg. He is a man I think\find\believe him to be nice. -F

He is a man whom I think\find\believe to be nice. -T



#### 15.定语从句可化简为不定式短语

关系代词所引导的定语从句中，若该关系代词之前有介词时，可将该从句变换成不定式短语

eg. He has no house in which he can live.

= He has no house in which to live.

= He has no house to live in.

= He has no house which to live in. -F



### 第二节、关系代词所有格

#### 1.关系代词所有格的功能

关系代词所有格乃人称代词所有格变化而成，和关系代词一样，引导定语从句，修饰前面的名词。

eg. She has an uncle whose name is Peter.

I like that house, whose location looks good to me.



#### 2.关系代词所有格使用三原则

whose可代替人或物，引导定语从句，修饰前面的名词。和关系代词一样，我们若想正确使用关系代词所有格，需要遵顼下列三项原则：

a. 关系代词所有格之前要有先行词，名词或代词

b. 该关系代词所有格之后的名词要作定语从句中的主语或宾语

c. 否则该关系代词所有格之前一定要有介词，该介词亦可移至定语从句句尾。

eg. I hate John, whose words are seldom true.

I hate John, whose words I don't believe(vt.).



#### 3.取代whose的结构

whose除可代替人意外，亦可代替物。代替物时, whose + n. 亦可被 the + n. + of which或 of which + the + n.所取代。
whose + n. = the + n. + of which = of which + the + n.

eg. I like to study in this school, whose faculty and facilities are top-notch.

= I like to study in this school, the faculty and facilities of which are top-notch.

= I like to study in this school, of which the faculty and facilities are top-notch.



#### 4.限制性定语从句与非限制性定语从句

与关系代词一样，关系代词所有格之前若无逗号，即为限制性定语从句，若有则为非限制性定语从句

eg. This is Tom, whose father is an English teacher.非限制性定语从句。这位是Tom，他父亲是英语老师。

I met a boy whose father is an English teacher.限制性定语从句。我遇到一位父亲是英语老师的男孩。



### 第三节、关系代词

#### 1.关系代词的种类

关系代词一共有四种，均有 介词 + 关系代词which变化而成

where= in which, on which, at which

when= in which, on which, at which

why = for which how = in which



#### 2.关系副词的功能

where用以修饰表地方的名词

when用以修饰表实践的名词

why用以修饰the reason



#### 3.where的用法

关系副词where可等于in which、on which、at which

eg. This is the city in which I met Mary

= This is the city where I met Mary.



#### 4.when的用法

表日子，介词用on（Sunday， on Dec. 21）；表年、月或一段时间时，介词要用in（July，1987，those days）；表几时几刻时，要用介词at（8 o'clock）

eg. He came on Friday, on which it was raining hard.

That's the year in which he graduated.

The sun rose at 5:30，at which most people were still in their dreams.



#### 5.why的用法

why只用于修饰the reason，系由for which变化而成

eg. I don't know the reason for which he cried.

= I don't know the reason why he cried.



#### 6.how 的用法

how只用以修饰the why，由in which变化而成

eg. That's the way in which he handled the problem.

= That's how he handled the problem. -better

That's the wey how he handled the problem. -F

= I am sick of the way in which he looks at me. 

= I am sick of the way he looks at me. -better



#### 7.关系副词使用要点

a.在限定修饰的定语从句中，除where以外，when及why皆可省略，而how则一定予以省略。

eg. That's the place he was born. -F

That's the place where he was born. -T

I shall never forget the day when he came.

= I shall never forget the day he came. -T

That's the reason why he left. -T

= That's the reason he left.

I am sick of the way how he looks at me. -F

I am sick of the way he looks at me. -T

b.where\when\why\how所修饰的名词若置于be动词之后作表语时，我们亦可省略该名词，而保留关系副词。

eg. That is the place where he was born.

= That's where he was born.

That is the way he did it.

= That is how he did it.

c.where\when\why\how亦可是做疑问代词，引导名词性从句，此时可作及物动词的宾语

eg. I know(vt.) where he is(名词性从句).

I don't know(vt.) how he'll do it(名词性从句).

d.where亦可作副词连词，等于in the place where.

eg. Put it where you found it.

= Put it in the place where you found it.

Where there is smoke, there is fire.

= In the place where there is smoke, there is fire.无风不起浪

e.the moment(when)...= the instant = the minute 一就...

三个短语均视为副词连词，之后的when均予省略，等于as soon as的意思

f.严谨的写作不可用that当作关系副词使用
eg. I remember the day that(when) he came.



### 第四节、关系指示代词

#### 1.关系只是代词由指示代词变化而成：

指示代词：that\this\those\these



#### 2.关系指示代词的功能

和关系代词一样，关系指示代词 + n. 可代表先行词或前面句中的部分概念，在所引导的定语从句中主要作主语或宾语

eg. He is arrogrant, this attitude I am sick of. -F

He is arrogrant, which attitude I am sick of. -T

He stayed there for a week, during this time he did nothing. -F

He stayed there for a week, during which time he did nothing. -T



### 第五节、复古关系代词

#### 1.复合关系代词的种类

代替人

whoever = anybody who, whomever = anybody whom

代替人或物

whichever 三者以上

= anyone which/who

whichever 二者

= either who\which

代替物

what = the things which 所...的东西

whatever = anything which ...的任何东西



#### 2.whoever的用法

使用whoever作复合关系代词时，要注意下列步骤

a. 先视whoever为两个词，即anybody who

b. anybody是代词，可在主句中当作主语或宾语；who为关系代词，引导定语从句，并在该从句中作主语
eg. Anybody who makes such a mistake should be punished.

= Whoever makes such a mistake should be punished.



#### 3.whomever的用法

因whom在定语从句中只能作宾语，而且此处的anybody，也只能在主句中作宾语，因此whomever绝不可作主语。

eg. Gave it to anybody whom you like(定语从句).

= Gave it to whomever you like.



#### 4.whichever的用法

whichever是指同一类的任何东西

eg. There are many books here. You may take any one which you like.

= There are many books here. You may take whichever you like.



#### 5.what的用法

a.首先要了解，what作复合关系代词时，可视为the thing which 所...的东西

eg. What he said is true.

b.以what造句时，要注意下列原则:

1)前面不可有先行词（名词）

2)将what视为the thing which

3)which在所引导的定语从句中可作主语、宾语或在be动词后作表语

eg. What bothers me is that I have no time.

= The thing(主语) which bothers me(定语从句) is that I have no time.



#### 6.whatever的用法

a.whatever与whichever不同之处在于后者指同一类的任何一项，前者指不同类的任何东西

b.what等于the thing which所...的东西；whatever等于anything that\anything which所...的东西，语气比what更强

eg. Whatever he said is true.

= Anything(主语) which he said(定语从句) is true.



#### 8.whatever及whoever亦可作副词连词

whatever及whoever亦可作副词连词，此时就不等于anything which或anybody who，而分别等于no matter that或no matter who

eg. Whatever he says, I don't believe him.

= No matter what he says, I don't believe him.

要注意的是whatever或whoever作副词连词时，所引导的状语从句与主句中间有逗号相隔。而作复合关系代词时，则无逗号相隔。

a. 复合关系代词

eg. Whatever he says is a lie.

= Anything that he says is a lie.

b.副词连词

eg. Whatever he says, it is a lie.

= No matter what he says, it is a lie.



#### 9.however有两种词性

一为连接性副词，译成然而；一为副词连词，译成无论如何

a. 连接性副词

eg. He is nice; however, I don't like him.

b. 副词连词

此时however等于no matter how

eg. No matter how(adv.) nice(adj.) he is, I don't like him.

= However nice he is, I don't like him.



#### 10.whether的用法：

表不论是否时，只需whether即可，不可使用no matter whether。whether本身就可作副词连词，引导状语从句，以逗号与主句相隔。

eg. No matter whether he is rich. -F

Whether he is rich, Jane will mary him. -T

a.引导状语从句

eg. Whether he is rich or not(状语从句), it doesn't matter(主句).他是否富有，那都没关系

b.引导名词性从句

eg. Whether he is rich doesn't matter.

= It does't matter whether he is rich.



#### 11.however的特殊句型

however作副词连词所引导的状语从句中，主语在之后若含有 be动词+形容词 时，要注意结构变化

eg. However poor he is, he doesn't want anyone to help him.

= However poor he may be, he doesn't want...



### 第六节、准关系代词

#### 1.准关系代词的种类

准关系代词只有三个：than、as、but

eg. I have more money than you.

He has as much money as I.

There is nothing but he knows.



#### 2.准关系代词形成的条件

than、as、but作准关系代词时，前面必须有个先行词。than、as、but之前若有名词，就可形成准关系代词



#### 3.than作准关系代词的用法

than之前若有名词时，than就等于 than +  the + 前面的名词 + 关系代词（who\whom\which）。可将than视为关系代词，在所引导的从句中要作主语、宾语或be动词后的表语。

a.主语

eg. I have more money(n.) than(准关系代词) is needed.

此处than等于than the money which，which作主语，之后有动词is needed。

b.宾语

eg. I have more money(n.) than(准关系代词) he needs(vt.).

本句中的than等于than the money which, which 作needs的宾语

c.be动词后的表语

eg. He is a better student(n.) than(准关代) you are(be动词).

than等于than the student that，that实际上是be动词are之后表语



#### 4.as作准关系代词的用法

as之前若有名词时，as就等于 as + the + 前面的名词 + 关系代词（who\whom\which）。可将as视为关系代词，在所引导的从句中要作主语、宾语或be动词后的表语。as若作准关系代词时，只用于下列短语中：

such + n. + as 像...那样的...

the same + n. as 和...相同的

as + adj. + n. + as 和...一样的

a. such + n. + as...

* 1)主语：

eg. I don't like such a man(n.) as tells(准关系代词) lies.

本句中的as等于as the man who, 关系代词who 在其后的定语从句中作主语，之后有动词tells lies。

* 2)宾语

eg. I respect such an honest man as you described.

此处的as等于as the man whom, 关系代词whom作及物动词described 之宾语

* 3)be动词后的表语，通常省略be动词

eg. In our company there is not such a man as Seven (is).

b.the same + n. + as..

* 1)主语

eg. I have the same book(n.) as(准关系代词) is laid on the desk.

as等于as the book which，关系代词which 作主语

* 2)宾语

eg. I have the same dictionary as you bought yesterday.

* 3)be动词后的表语

eg. I have the same dictionary(n.) as(准关系代词) this one.

本句中as等于as the dictionary that，关系代词that作is后之表语

c. as + adj. + n. + as...

* 1)主语

eg. He is as diligent a man as ever lived.

* 2)宾语

eg. I have as good a dictionary as you do.

as = as the dictionary which ,关系代词作do之宾语

* 3)be动词后的表语，通常省略be动词

eg. He is as good a man(n.) as(准关系代词) John is.



#### 5.such + n 之后绝不可用like加以修饰

eg. Such a man like him is bad. -F

Such a man as he(is) is bad. -T



#### 6.the same as(准关系代词) 和...相同的... 两个人或物

the same that(关系代词) 就是同一个 一个人或物

eg. I have the same book as he is reading. 两本书

I borrowed the same book which he did last week. -F

I borrowed the same book that he borrowed last week. -T 同一本书



#### 7.as可代替主句

单独使用as时，as亦可作关系代词，等于which，用以代替整个主句

eg. He is nice, which is known to us.

= He is nice, as is known to us.

使用as取代which时，要注意下列要点

* a. as引导的从句可置于主句的前后，而which引导的从句则只能置于主句之后。

eg. He is nice, which we all know.

= He is nice, as we all know.

= As we all know, he is nice.

Which we all know, he is nice. -F

* b. as + be + p.p. 时，be动词可以省略

eg. He is nice, which was mentioned(p.p.) before.

= He is nice, as was mentioned(p.p.) before.

= He is nice, as mentioned before.



#### 8.只能与单数可数名词使用的结构

as good a student as... 

as diligent a man as...

下列短语中，若置名词时，只能置单数可数名词

so...that... 如此...以致...

as...as... 和...一样地... 第一个as为副词，译成一样地，第二个为连词。译为和

too...to... 太...而不...

how... 多么地



#### 10.准关系代词but的用法

but作准关系代词时，只用于 no + 名词 之后，此时but等于who\whom\which

There is no + 名词 + who\whom\which\that ... not

= There is no + 名词 + but

a.定语从句中有be动词时，保留该be动词

eg. There is no one who is not interested in it.

= There is no one but is interested in it.

b.定语从句中有一般助动词(can\will\may\should时，保留该助动词)

eg. There is nothing that he cannot do.

= There is nothing but he can do.

c.定语从句中有do\does\did等助动词时，要先去掉do\does\did，再依时态、人称将之后的动词还原。

eg. There is no book which he doesn't like to read.

= There is no book but he likes to read.没有他不爱读的书
