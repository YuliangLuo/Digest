### 第一节 否定倒装句

否定倒装句就是将否定副词、否定副词短语和否定状语从句移至句首的倒装句。



#### 1.否定副词、否定副词短语和否定状语从句

a. 常用的否定副词

never从不、hardly=scarcely几乎不、rarely很少、seldom很少、little一点儿也不

b. 常用的否定副词短语

by no means绝对不、in no way绝对不、on no account绝对不、under no circumstances绝对不、in no situation绝对不

c. 常用的否定状语从句：

not until + S + V 直到

only when + S + V只有到...的时候

only after + S + V 只有到...之后



#### 2.如何倒装

先将否定副词、否定副词短语或否定状语从句移至句首，再检查原结构主语之后的动词，采用问句型倒装

a. be动词

主语之后有be动词时，be动词与主语要倒装

eg. He is never(否定副词) happy.

= Never is he happy.

He is happy only when Mary is with him.否定状语从句

= Only when Mary is with him is he happy.只有Mary和他在一起时，他才快乐

b. 助动词

主语之后有助动词时，助动词与主语要倒装

eg. He can hardly(否定副词) move.

Hardly can he move. 他几乎不能动

c. 一般动词

主语之后有一般动词时，先在主语之前按动词时态及主语人称之不同，分别置助动词do、does、did，再将动词变成原形动词。

eg. He(第三人称单数) seldom(否定副词) sings(一般现在时).

= Seldom does he sing(原形V).



#### 3.only + 介词短语 及only + then

only + 介词短语 或 only + then唯有在那时，均可视为否定副词短语，置于句首时，亦采用倒装句

eg. Only by doing so you can succeed. -F

Only by doing so can you succeed. -T 只有这么做你才会成功

Only then I left. -F

Only then did I leave. -T



#### 4.not only...but also... 不仅...而且...

= not merely...but also...

= not only...but...as well

= not merely...but...as well

a. 本短语可以连接对等的单词、短语和从句

单词

eg. Not only I(S.) but also he(S.) is wrong.

短语

eg. I came not only to see(不定式短语) you but also to say goodbye to you(不定式短语).我来不仅是为了见你，也是来跟你道别的。

从句

eg. He was fired not merely because he was lazy (状语从句)but because he failed to meet my requirements(状语从句).

b. 本短语亦可连接对等的句子，但由于not only置于句首，视为否定副词，第一个句子要倒装。but also仅为连词，故其后的第二个句子不须倒装，但also则一定要省略，或移至句子中，亦可将also省略后在句尾处加as well

eg. Not only she can sing, but also she can dance. -F

Not only can she sing, but she can(also) dance. -T

Not only can she sing, but she can dance as well. -T



#### 5.not  + a + 单数可数名词 连一个...都没有

本短语若作及物动词的宾语时，亦可移至句首，采用倒装结构

eg. I did not see a soul over there.

Not a soul did I see over there.



#### 6.hardly、scarcely

这两个副词因为是否定副词，故置于句首时，句子要倒装。两词意思相同，均译成几乎不，用法亦相同

eg. Hardly he can do it. -F

Hardly can he do it. -T

注意scarcely\hardly + any + 名词 几乎没有

= almost not + any + 名词

= almost no + 名词 此时若作主语，置于句首，不可采用倒装结构。

eg. Scarcely did any student pass the exam. -F

Scarcely any student passed the exam. -T

Almost no student passed the exam. -T

但句中有scarcely/hardly + a + 单数名词作及物动词的宾语时，可将scarcely\hardly + a + 单数名词置于句首，仍采用倒装句

eg. He hardly spoke a word.

Hardly a word did he speak.



#### 7.nowhere = in no place 在任何地方都不

此亦为否定副词，置于句首要采用倒装句

eg. Nowhere I could find such a man. -F

Nowhere could I find such a man. -T



#### 8.表示一...就...的句型

a. 同时态的状语从句

eg. As soon as she saw me, she passed out.

= Once she saw me, she passed out.

= The instant she saw me, she passed out

Immediately\Instantly\Directly she saw me, she passed out.

此时immediately、instantly、directly视为副词连词，等于as soon as。但这种用法已不常见于报章杂志中。

b. On/Upon + N/V-ing, S + V

同主语

eg. As soon as I finished the job, I went home.

Upon\On finishing the job, I went home.

不同主语

eg. As soon as he arrived, I left.

Upon his arriving, I left.

c. 否定倒装的状语从句

1) 此类句型一共有三种

a) no sooner...than...没有比...早多少

b) hardly/scarcely...when...

当...时，几乎没...

c) hardly/scarcely...before...

在...之前，几乎没...

以上实际均译为一...就...

2) hardly与scarcely均等于almost not，故之后的when与before可以互换。只是现在的英语多采用hardly/scarcely...when，而很少有人采用hardly/scarcely...before

3) 由于no sooner、hardly、scarcely均为否定副词，故置于句首时，过去完成时助动词had应与主语倒装

No sooner had she seen me than she passed out.

Hardly had she seen me when she passed out.

Scarcely had she seen me when she passed out.



### 第二节 so/such倒装句

#### 1.句中有be动词时，该be动词与主语倒装

eg. He is so helpful that we all like him.

So helpful is he that we all like him.

#### 2.句中有助动词时，该助动词与主语倒装

eg. He has done so well that he deserves our respect.

So well has he done that he deserves our respect.

#### 3.句中若为一般动词时，不可直接倒装

须在主语之前先按该动词时态及人称变化，分置do、does或did，再将该动词变成原形动词

eg. He came so late that he missed the train.

= So late did he come that he missed the train.他到得太晚，而没赶上火车。



### 第三节 地点副词倒装句

#### 1.三种倒装句型

地点副词there\here或地点副词短语in the room\at the station\by the window等置于句首时，亦可形成倒装句，只是倒装得句法与前两种倒装句完全不同。

第一型：

主语 + 不及物动词 + 地点副词\地点副词短语

地点副词\地点副词短语 + 不及物动词 + 主语

eg. A(S.) girl sat(vi.) there(地点副词).

There sat(vi.) a girl(S.).

第二型：

主语 + be动词 + 过去分词 + 地点副词\地点副词短语

地点副词\地点副词短语 + be动词 + 过去分词 + 主语

eg. A man was(b.) locked(p.p.) behind the door(地点副词短语).

第三型：

主语 + be 动词 + 现在分词 + 地点副词\地点副词短语

现在分词 + 地点副词\地点副词短语 + be动词 + 主语

eg. A girl is(be) sitting(现在分词) over(地点副词短语) there.

Singing over there is a girl, who is my girlfriend.



#### 2.主语必为普通名词或专有名词

此类倒装句中得主语一定是普通名词，或专有名词。若主语为代词则不可采用倒装句；也就是说地点副词仍可放在句首，但句子不倒装。至于地点副词短语则不宜放在句首。

eg. He(代词) stood there(地点副词).

There stood he. -F There he stood. -T



#### 3.介副词的倒装

介副词亦视为地点副词，置于句首时，亦采用完全相同的倒装句。所谓介副词，就是由表示场所的介词变成的副词。这些词之后有宾语时就称介词，若无宾语时就是介副词(由介词变成的副词)

a. 介词

eg. John walked in(介) the room(宾语).

b. 介副词

eg. He walked in(介副词).

He climbed up(介副词).

c. 倒装方式

eg. A boy walked(vi.) in.

In walked a boy.

注意

a. 主语为代词时，不得采用倒装结构

In walked he. -F In he walked. -T

b. away视为地点副词，用法相同 

eg. John went away. = Away went John.

Away went he. -T

c. here亦为地点副词，用法亦相同

eg. Mary comes here.

Here comes Mary.



#### 4.there 与地点副词

地点副词短语在句首时，前面可置there或其他相关副词，用以强调该地点副词短语。there可置于地点副词短语之前或之后。但其他相关副词只能置于地点副词短语之前。

a. there

eg. On top of the hill(地点副词短语) lies a beautiful villa.

= There on top of the hill lies a beautiful villa.

= On top of the hill lies a beautiful villa.

b. 相关副词

eg. Deep(相关副词) in the mountains(地点副词短语) lies a small village.



#### 5.倒装句的好处

倒装句的主语在句尾，之后可接定语从句、分词短语或介词短语，用以修饰主语，因此可以扩大主语的内容，并可避免主语在句首时，主语与动词间修饰语过多的毛病。

eg. 未倒装时

A man(主语) who held a knife in one hand(定语从句), looking as if he wanted to kill somebody(分词短语), stood(vi.) there(地点副词).

倒装之后

There stood(vi.) a man(主语) who held a knife in one hand, looking as if he wanted to kill sombody.



#### 6.here与there的习惯用语

注意下列用here或there置于句首的句子，主语为代词，因此不倒装

a. Here we are.

b. Here you are.

c.There you go again.

d. There you are.



### 第四节 完全倒装句

#### 1.基本句型

此类倒装句由下列句型演变而成：

主语 + be动词 + 形容词（含可作形容词的过去分词或现在分词）

形容词 + be动词 + 主语

eg. He(主语) who is content is(be) happy(adj.). 

= Happy is he who is content. 知足者常乐



#### 2.使用时机

此类完全倒装句的主语，通常泛指所有的人或物。故主语有凡是...的人或物之意时，均可使用本倒装句。

eg. A man(主语) who often helps others is(be) praiseworthy(adj.).

= Praiseworthy is a man who often helps others. 常助人的人值得赞扬



### 第五节 as取代though的倒装法

#### 1.as取代though的句型

a. though + 主语 + be动词 + 形容词

形容词可移至句首，再以as取代though

eg. Though he(S.) is(be) nice(adj.), I dislike him.

= Nice as he is, I dislike him.

b. though + 主语 + be动词 + 名词

名词可移至句首，再以as取代though。但名词若为单数可数名词，移至句首时，原有的不定冠词a或an一定要省略。

eg. Though he is a nice boy, I dislike him.

A nice boy as he is, I dislike him. -F

Nice boy as he is, I dislike him. -T

c. though引导的状语从句中有副词时，可将副词移至句首，此时though亦可用as取代

eg. Though he studied hard(adv.), he failed to pass the exam.

= Hard as he studied, he failed to pass the exam.

d. though引导的状语从句若无副词时，可在句首添入副词much,再接as或though即可。

eg. Though he loves me(无副词), I dislike him.

= Much as he loves me, I dislike him.

= As much as he loves me, I dislike him.

e. though引导的状语从句有助动词may时，其后原形动词可置于句首，再接as或though即可

eg. Though you may try, you still can't make him change his mind.

= Try as you may, you still can't make him change his mind. 尽管你怎么尝试，仍无法令他改变心意。



#### 2.as表因为的用法

as若置于句首，则表示因为之意，是副词连词，等于because

eg. As he is nice, I like him.

= Because he is nice, I like him.

但as引导的从句若为主语 + 一般动词的结构，且为肯定句时，可有下列变化

eg. As he lives here, he may have ample changes to view the beautiful scenery.

= Living here as he does, he may have ample changes to view the beautiful scenery.

其步骤为：

第一步，将as从句中的动词移至句首，变成现在分词

第二步，再于主语之后按人称与时态变化添加助动词do、does、did
