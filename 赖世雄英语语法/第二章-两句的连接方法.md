## 第二章、两句的连接方法

### 概说

两句连接的方法不外下列六种方式：

第一种：破折号(---)

第二种：冒号(:)

第三种：分号(;)

第四种：并列连词

第五种：副词连词

第六种：关系词

### 第一节、连接符号

#### 1.破折号

a.此类服好有别于连字符。前者用于连接句子或同位语，而后者则用以连接单词，形成复合词

eg. Water-skiing is my hobby.

b.破折号连接句子时，用来强调第一个句子，以补充意思的不足。此时破折号有也就是说，或换句话说的意思。

eg. He is trash---he is good for nothing.

c.破折号亦可用来连接同位语

eg. He finally made his purpose known to us---to chase Susun(不定式短语，作同位语).



#### 2.冒号，此类符号亦可用以连接句子，来强调前面句中的名词

eg. He has made his goal known:he wants to be a scientist.



#### 3.分号：

a.此类符号在文章中较常出现，等于逗号+连词

eg. He is a man of principle;we all respect him.

=He is a man of principle, so we all respect him.

b.句中的对等语原本用逗号相隔，再以并列连词相连，但若某对等语中间有插入语时，会多出一些逗号。为了拘役清楚起见，可用分号取代逗号。

eg. He said that he had no money, that he had no friends to count on, and that he expected me to help him.

eg. He enjoys dancing, which is his hobby; swimming, which he often does on Sundays; and jogging.



### 第二节、并列连词

#### 1.基本的并列连词一共只有三个：and|or|but。此种连词可用以连接对等的单词，短语或句子，故称为并列连词。

a.单词

eg. He is kind and handsome(对等的形容词作表语).

b.短语

eg. He is not good at English but poor at it(对等的形容词短语作表语).

c.句子

eg. I like John, who is easy to get along with but whose brother is too arrogant to associate with(对等的定语从句).



#### 2.and\or\but衍生的其他连词

and - both ... and ...

or - either ... or ... \ neither ... nor ...

but - not ... but ... \not only... but...

a. 单词

eg. Both Peter and Mary (对等的主语) work hard.

b. 短语

eg. He want to the United States not noly to learn English but also to know more about American culture.

c. 句子

eg. He succeeded both because he was intelligent and because he worked hard.



#### 3.as well as与rather than作并列连词

as well as... 以及... rather than... 而非

a. 单词

eg. We as well as John(对等的主语) like it.

b.短语

eg. He came here to learn English as well as to know more about life.

c. 句子

eg. He failed because he was lazy rather than because he was not intelligent.

注意：

as well as或rather than 连接主语时，该句动词始终要随第一个主语做变化

eg. He as well as I is interested in music.

= He no less than I is interested in music.

= He together with me is interested in music.

= He along with me is interested in music.

由于as well as与 no less than为并列连词，故之后接主格形态I， 以与He 对等。而together with或 along with则为介词，故之后接宾格形态me, 以作为with之宾语。

eg. He rather than I is interested in music.

= He no less than I is interested in music.

= He together with me is interested in music.

= He along with me is interested in music.



#### 4.使用both...and等连词应注意事项：

both...and.../either...or.../neither...nor.../not...but.../not...only...but also等连词时，要注意下列事项：

a.连接主语时, both...and...之后始终接复数动词；其余连词接主语时，动词则要随最近的主语做单复数变化。

eg. Both he and I are happy about it.

Not only they but also John has passed the exam.

b.both...and.../neither...nor.../not...but...等三组连词通常不用来连接句子，而not only...but also...则可用来连接句子，唯not only引导的句子要采用倒装结构

* 1) 句子是可以单独存在的，两个句子可以通过连词形成并列句，也可以与状语从句、定语从句并存形成主从复合句
* eg. He seems to like it.
* When he came(状语从句), I was studying(主句).
* 2) Both he is good at English, and he is good at math. -F
* He is good at both English and math. -T
* Not only can she sing, but she can also dance.

c.not only由于是否定副词的关系，若置于第一个分句之前，该主句要采用倒装结构。而but also则为连词，所连接的第二个分局不须倒装。倒装原则依动词形式之不同，可分为下列三种情况：

* 1) be动词与主语倒装
* eg. Not only he is clever, but he is polite. -F
* Not only is he clever, but he is polite. -T
* 2) 助动词与主语倒装
* eg. Not only she can sing, but she can also dance.
* Not only can she sing, but she can dance.
* 3) 一般动词：倒装时要按主语人称与动词时态另加do\does\did于主语前，原有的动词一律改为原形动词
* eg. Not only she sings well, but she dances beautifully. -F
* Not only does she sing well, but she dances beautifully. -T 

d. not only...but also之中的also通常可以省略。若不省略，则连接单词或短语时but also不可分开，但连接句子时，but also一定要分开，也就是将also置于句中。

* 1) 连接单词或短语
* eg. He came here not only to learn English but  (also) to know more about life.
* 2) 连接句子
* eg. Not only can she dance,but also she can sing. -F
* Not only can she dance, but she can also sing. -T

e. not noly...but also... = not only...but... as well

eg. Not only can she sing, but she can dance.

f. not only...but also... = not merely...but also... = not just...but also...

eg. He enjoys not only dancing but also singing.

= He enjoys not just dancing but singing as well



### 第三节、连词副词

#### 1.副词连词只能连接从句

eg. I like him because he is easy to get along with.



#### 2.常用的副词连词

because、though、if、unless、as soon as、once等



#### 3.副词连词引导状语从句

副词连词冠于任何一个从句前面，该从句就才成为状语从句，而状语从句绝不能单独存在，一定要于主句共存。整个状语从句可视为副词，用来修饰主句。

eg. I like him. Because he is nice. -F

because he is nice为状语从句，不可单独存在



#### 4.状语从句的位置

任何一个副词连词所引导的从句若置于主句之后，两句之间通常不置逗号。但若该状语从句置于主句之前，则两句之间通常置逗号。

eg. Though he did poorly on the test(状语从句), his father didn't scold(主句).

= His father didn't scold him though he did poorly on the test(状语从句).



#### 5.避免双重连接

though\although\even if\even though与but均为连词，故形成双重连接，这亦是错误的结构。



#### 6.条件句与主句的时态

when、if、once、as soon as、unless等副词连词所引导的从句，亦可表示一种条件，形成所谓的条件句。若用来表示将来的状况时，该条件句的时态要采用一般现在时或现在完成时，而主句的时态则用一般将来时

If\Once\As soon as\Unless\When + 一般现在时（或现在完成时）动词，主语 + will +原形动词

eg. As soon as I will have done it, I'll let you know. -F

= As soon as I have done it, I'll let you know. -T

If he will have time, he'll come here. -F

=If he has time, he'll come here. -T



#### 7.连接性副词

有些副词有连接的意味，但却不能作连词用，此类副词就称为连接性副词。此类副词前面要有分号，用以连接两句。

a. however\nevertheless然而，有连词but的意味

eg. He is nice; however\nevertheless, I don't like him.

= He is nice; but I don't like him.

b.therefore\thus因此，有连词so的意味

eg. He is kind;therefore\thus we all like him.

= He is kind, so we all like him.

= He is kind.Therefore\Thus we all like him.

c.moreover\furthermore\in addition此外，有连词and的意味

eg. He dances well;furthermore\moreover\in addition, she is good at singing.

= She dances well, and she is good at singing.

d.besides此外

besides与in addition均表此外，不过前者多用于有否定或消极意味的句中，而in addition则用于肯定句或积极意味的句中

eg. I don't think I will go to the movies with you, John. I'm too tired; besides, I have no money.

注意：

furthermore、moreover、besides、in addition通常只置于主语前，而不插入句中



#### 8.while作副词连词及并列连词的用法：

a.表当...时，while视为副词连词，引导状语从句。

eg. While I was writing a letter(状语从句), she was doing the dishes(主句).

b.表而...时，while视为并列连词，连接并列句

eg. He is nice, while\whereas his brother is bad.

= While he is nice, his brother is bad.



#### 9.其他重要的副词连词:

a.as 当;虽然;因为

* 1) as作当...时，相当于when之意

* eg. As I was young, I was quite happy.

* 2) as作虽然...时，等于though; though引导的状语从句有下列句型变化:

* eg. Though he is rich, he isn't happy.

* = Rich as he is, he isn't happy.

* = As rich as he is, he isn't happy.

* 3) as作因为...时，相当于because之意

* eg. As he apologized to me, I'm going to forgive him.

* = Because he has apologized to me, I'm going to forgive him.

b. where= in the place where=in the place in which在...的地方

eg. Where I live, people are very nice.

=In the place where I live, people are very nice.

c. once一旦

eg. Once you hear any good news, let me know.

=As soon as you hear any good news, let me know.

d. or否则

eg. You must work hard, or I'll fire you.

=You must work hard;otherwise I'll fire you.

e.nor 也不

nor是连词，用以连接两个否定的句子；nor之后的分句要采用类似问句结构的倒装句型。

eg. She can't sing, nor can she dance.

f. so that这样的话，仪表

eg. I got up early so that I could get to school on time.

= I got up early in order that I could get to school on time.

g. so...that...如此...以至于...

eg. He is so nice that we all like him.

h. in that 因为

in that 相当于because，只是in that 引导的状语从句多置于主句之后，而because引导的状语从句可置于主句之前或之后

eg. He is great in that he speaks five different languages.

i. except that只可惜，只不过是

eg. He is nice except that he is a little shy.

j. since因为;自从

since表因为时，相当于because之意;表自从时，所引导的状语从句采用一般过去时，主句则为现在完成时或现在完成进行时。

eg. Since you've finished the work, you may leave anytime.

He has been studying quite hard since he went to college.
