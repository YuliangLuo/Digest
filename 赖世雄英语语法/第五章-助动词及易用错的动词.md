## 第五章 助动词及易用错的动词

### 第一节、助动词

1.助动词的定义：

助动词就是一种帮助动词的此类，使用时置于动词前，使动词能表现出时态、语态、否定句、疑问句等变化



2.助动词的种类：

be(am\is\are\was\were\have\has\had been)、have(has\had)、do(does\did)、shall(should)、will(would)、can(could)、may(might)、must、ought to、need、dare、used to

#### 第一种 be 动词

1.be动词原为不完全不及物动词，译成是，此时要用名词或形容词作表语

eg. He(主语) is(不完全vi.) handsome(adj.作表语).



2.但be动词之后亦可接现在分词或过去分词表进行时或被动语态，此时be动词就称为助动词

a. be + 现在分词 = 进行时

eg. He is(助动词) reading(现在分词) a book.

b. be + 及物动词的过去分词 = 被动语态

eg. He was(助动词) elected(过去分词) chairman.



#### 第二种have

have、has、had + 过去分词 已经...

以上结构构成动词的完成时态，have为助动词，译成已经

eg. He has written the letter(现在完成时)

I had finished the task before he came.(过去完成时)



#### 第三种 do

do、does、did等助动词可用以形成下列结构

1.do\does\did + not + 原形动词

eg. He did not see me.

注意：

a. 任何动词与not连用，形成否定时，一定要靠do、does、did再加上not协助，不可造这样的句子

eg. I not love him. -F

I don't love him. -T

b. 动词前若置Not以外的否定副词，如never从未、seldom不常、rarely很少、hardly几乎不、scarcely几乎不/非常少等，则不须与do、does、did连用

eg. He did never live here. -F

He never lived here. -T



2.疑问句

eg. Did you know it?



3.强势语气：

即在肯定句的动词前，按时态、人称置入do、does、或did，再将动词改为原形，此时do、does、did均译成的确

eg. He worked(一般过去时) hard.



4.否定倒装句

eg. Never did I know that he was so stupid.



5.代动词pro-verb

此种助动词用以代替句中已出现过的动词及其后的其他词类

eg. Did you read this book? Yes, I did(= read this book)



#### 第四种 shall、will

1.shall、will表将要，之后接原形动词



3.在下列结中，仍习惯用shall代替will

a.征求对方意见时

eg. Shall I open the door?

= Would you like me to open the door?

b.请求对方合作时

eg. Shall we go for a walk?

= Let's go for a walk, shall we?

c.命令对方时

you shall = you must 你必须

d.向对方保证某种承诺时：

You shall 你一定会

eg. You shall have the present.

= I promise that you will have the present.



#### 第五种 should

1.should之后接原形动词



2.should的主要功能就是表示一种义务，译为应当，此时等于ought to

eg. You should be kind to others.



3.但在下列结构中，习惯上亦用should，有其不同的意思

a.It's natural\proper\right\advisable\desirable\no wonder that...should... ...会...

eg. It's natural that he should get angry.

b.It's necessary\imperative\essential\important\urgent that...should...应当 ...应当...是有必要的

eg. It's necessary that he should finish the work before leaving.

c.It's surprising that...should居然... 令人惊异的是...居然...

d.It's a pity\regret\regrettable that...should... 令人遗憾的是...居然...

eg. It is a pity that he should be so rude.



4.意志动词如表建议(propose\recomment\suggest)、要求(ask\demand\desire\require\insist\request)、命令(order\command)、规定(rule\regulate)等，之后若有that从句作宾语时，that从句中亦使用should，而should往往亦予以省略

eg. He suggested that we should leave at once.

They demanded that he should be quiet.



5.lest表以免，为副词连词，所引导的从句亦使用should，而should亦可予以省略

eg. He came early lest he should be late.

= He came early for fear that he might be late.



6.If从句若表示与将来状况相反时，应使用should，表万一之意

eg. If you should be late again, you will spoil the plan.



7.在一般过去时中，要用should代替shall

eg. I said to him,"I shall be at home this evening."



8.should have + 过去分词

1.would是will的过去式，用以表示过去将来时

本句型属虚拟语气，若与现在事实相反，that从句用一般过去时；若与过去事实相反，则用过去完成时

a.与现在事实相反：

eg. I would rather that he were here.

= I wish that he were here.

b.与过去事实相反

eg. I would rather that he had been here yesterday.

= I wish that he had been here yesterday.

* 1) must have + 过去分词 一定曾经...
* eg. He looks nervous; he must have stolen your money.
* 2) may have + 过去分词 可能曾经...
* eg. He looks nervous; he may have stolen your money.

c.疑问句中表对过去事物的推论，则用can + S + have + 过去分词，译成有可能吗

eg. Can he have stolen your money?



6.could为can的过去式，通常与另一一般过去时动词连用，用以表示过去的状况

eg. She could speak English well when she was ten.



7.would、could亦可使用在问句中，以表示客气的语气

eg. Could\Would you please do it for me.



8.could=was/were able to

使用于一般过去时中，表示过去的能力
