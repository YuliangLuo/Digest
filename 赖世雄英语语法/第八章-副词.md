## 第八章 副词

### 第三节、重要的副词用法

#### 1.very、much 很、非常

a. very不可单独修饰动词，而very much则可，多用于肯定句中，其位置应在句尾

eg. I very like you. -F

I like(vt.) you very much(adv.). -T

b. much亦可修饰动词，但多限于问句或否定句中，若在问句中，much应置于句尾，若在否定句中，much可置于动词前或句尾

eg. Do you to to New York often?

I don't much like(vt.) living in the country. = I don't like(vt.) living in the country much.

c. very可修饰一般形容词或副词，但形容词或副词变成比较级时，则只能用much修饰。

eg. He walked very slowly(adv.). -T

He walked very more slowly that I. -F He walked much more slowly that I. -T

d. 修饰too时只能用much，不能用very

eg. He is very too young. -F He is much too young. -T

修饰比较级或too的副词通常有六个

much、far、a lot、a great deal、still、even

e. 用现在分词若可作形容词用，且可译成令人...的时，均使用very修饰，常用的此类现在分词如下

interesting、boring、confusing、charming、tiring、annoying

f. 凡过去分词若可作形容词用，且可译成感到...的时，此类过去分词均与情绪或心境有关，亦可用very或very much修饰。常用的此类过去分词如下

interested、bored、confused、charmed、tired、annoyed

g. very亦可当形容词以修饰名词，表正是那个，放在定冠词the之后。此时名词之后若有定语从句修饰，其关系代词必须用that取代who、whom、which。

eg. He is the very\just\the same man that came here yesterday.



#### 2.little、a little

a. little作副词时，视为否定副词，译成一点儿都不，等于no之意

eg. The patient's condition is littele better that it was yesterday.

b. a little作副词时，译成有点儿

eg. The patient's condition is getting/becoming a little better.

c. little作否定副词时，通常修饰动词think、dream、expect

eg. I little thought that you would do it.我根本没料到你会做那件事



#### 3.no longer = no more = not...any longer = not...any more 不再

eg. He is no longer here.

= He is here no more. = No longer is he here. = He is not here any longer.



#### 4.sometimes、sometime、some time、some times

a. sometimes 有时候

此为频率副词，使用时通常置于句首，亦可置于句尾

eg. Sometimes he comes here for a visit.

= He comes here for a visit once in a while.

b.sometime 某时（不知何时）

可用于一般过去时或一般将来时，使用时通常与另一明确的时间副词或副词短语连用。

eg. 一般过去时：I saw him sometime yesterday morning.明确的时间副词，我昨天早上某个时间见过他

一般将来时：I'll be here sometime tomorrow. 明确的时刻

c. some time 一段时间

eg. I'll stay here some time. 我会在这儿待一阵子

#### 5.ago、before、since、after

a. ago 表距现在若干时间以前，时态用一般过去时

eg. When I met Jim last Monday, he told me he had just gotten back from a trip to Lake Placid two days before.

上周一我遇到吉米时，他告诉我他两天前刚从宁静湖那里旅游回来

注意，ago不能单独使用，而before却可以，即before可单独作副词，修饰句中的动词，通常与现在完成时、过去完成时以及一般过去时连用。

eg. I met him ago. -F

I met him two hours before. -T

c. since 自从...

1) since可作副词连词，引导一般过去时的状语从句，修饰时态为现在完成（进行）时或过去完成（进行）时之主句。

eg. I have studied English(现在完成时) since I moved(一般过去时) here in 2001.

2) since可作副词用，修饰现在完成（进行）时或过去完成（进行）时之主句。since译成之后，可置于句尾或句中完成时助动词have、has、had之后。

eg. I moved here in 2001 and have studied English since.

 = I moved here in 2001 and have since studied English.我于2001年迁到此处，之后就一直学习英语

注意，since作副词时，句型结构一定为：主语 + 一般过去时动词 + 明确的时间副词短语 + and + 主语 + have\has\had + since + 过去分词(过去分词 + since)

eg. He(主语) left(一般过去时) town in 2002(明确时间副词) and I haven't seen(现在完成时) him since.

3) 作介词用，之后加明确的时间名词作宾语，亦可用动名词作宾语

eg. I have been studying English since(介词) 2002(明确的时间名词).

但若是时间段，则用for: I have been studying English for ten years. -T

since之前亦可用副词ever修饰

eg. Ever since he came here, he has been arguing with Mary.自从他来到此地，便一直和玛丽争吵

d. after之后

after作副词时亦译成之后，但与since作副词时不同的是：since修饰完成时，而after则修饰过去时，此时等于later或afterwards

eg. He fell ill on Monday and died three days after. 他星期一生病，3天后就死了。
