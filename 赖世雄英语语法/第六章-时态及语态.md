2）过去完成进行时 eg. When I called, he had been writing a letter for two hours. 我打电话来时，他信已持续写了两个小时。



#### 2.使用一般现在时的时机

主语 + 一般现在时动词

a. 表知觉、状态、所有

eg. You look worried.

b. 表习惯的动作

eg. He writes a letter every day.

He always takes a bus home.

表习惯性的动作常以时间副词修饰

c. 表真理、事实、格言

eg. The sun rises in the east.

d. 表将来

begin、start、arrive、leave、come、go等动词可用一般现在时表将来

#### 3.使用一般过去时的时机：

主语 + 一般过去时动词

a. 表过去的动作、习惯、状态：

eg. I saw him yesterday.

b. 表过去的经验（亦可用现在完成时表示）

eg. Did you ever see her before.

= Have you ever seen her before.

c. 句中若有after、until、before等连词引导的从句，由于时间先后很清楚，可用一般过去时代替过去完成时

eg. After I had finished the work, I went home.

= After I finished the work, I want home.



#### 4.使用一般将来时的动机

主语 + will + 原形动词，表将来发生的动作或状态

eg. It will rain tomorrow.

a. 由连词when、unless、if、once等所引导的状语从句表示某条件时，一定要用一般现在时，而主句用一般将来时

eg. When I have money, I will buy a car.

I won't buy a car unless I have money.

b. is/am/are going to + 原形动词 = will + 原形动词 将要....

eg. He is going to come.

= He will come.



#### 5.使用现在完成时的时机

主语 + have + 现在分词（have译成已经或曾经）

a. 用以表示到现在为止完成的动作：

eg. She has already come.

He hasn't gone to work yet.

b. 用以表示到现在为止的经验

eg. I have met him several times.

c. 用以表示到现在为止仍在继续的动作或状态

eg. She has lived here for 10 years.(And she still lives here.)

注意：

表曾去过的经历时，用have been，而非have gone

eg. He has gone to Hong Kong.

= He has been to Honk Kong.



#### 6.使用过去完成的时机

主语 + had + 过去分词（had 译成已经或曾经）

用以表示截至过去某时为止所完成的动作或经历

eg. He had studied English for 10 years before he left for the States. 他赴美之前已学过10年英语

注意：过去完成时不能单独存在，要与另一个一般过去时从句或表过去之副词短语连用，即在过去不同时间发生的两种动作

先发生的动作 - 用过去完成时表示

后发生的动作 - 用一般过去时表示

eg. I lost the book which my father had given me. 我弄丢了父亲给我的书——我父亲先给我的书，我后来弄丢了



#### 7.使用将来完成时的时机

主语 + will have + 过去分词（will have译成将已经）

eg. He will have arrived in Chicago by this time tomorrow. 明天这个时候，他将已抵达芝加哥

He will have lived here for 10 years by the end of this month. 到月底，他就在此地住满10年了。



#### 8.使用现在进行时的时机

主语 + is/am/are + 现在分词（is/am/are 译成 正在）

a. 用以表示现在正在做的动作

eg. What are you doing?

b. 用以表示即将发生的动作，常与表将来的副词连用，此时is/am/are译成即将

eg. He is coming today. = He will be coming today. 他即将于今天前来。



#### 9.使用过去完成时的时机

主语 + was/were + 现在分词(was/were译成正在)

eg. He will be studying English at this time tomorrow. 明天此时，他将在读英语



#### 11.使用现在完成进行时的时机：

主语 + have/has been + 现在分词(have/has been 译成一直都在)，用以表示一直继续到现在且仍将继续下去的动作：

eg. She has been working with this company for 5 years. 她在这家公司服务已经有5年时间了——她仍将服务下去



#### 12.使用过去完成进行时的时机

主语 + had been + 现在分词(had been译成一直都在)，用以表示一直继续到过去某时，而当时仍在继续进行的动作。与过去完成时一样，过去完成进行时不能单独存在，须与一般过去时连用

eg. He told us that he had been studying German since 2001. 他告诉我们他从2001年起就一直学德语。



#### 13.使用将来完成进行时的时机

主语 + will have been + 现在分词（will have been译成将一直在）表一直继续到将来某时，而将继续进行的动作

eg. I will have been teaching English for ten years by the end of this year.



#### 14.时态的前后一致

a. 主句若为一般现在时，从属从句除过去完成时、过去完成进行时不能用以外，其他时态皆可用

eg. I think he has come. \ he is coming. \ he already came.\ he will have done it by the end of this month.\ he was singing a song when I came yesterday.\ he had come. -F\ he had been sleeping. -F \ he had been sleeping when I came -T(因为有一般过去时之状语从句when I came)

b. 主句为一般过去时时，则从属从句不得用表现在或将来的时态，但可使用一般过去时、过去完成时、过去进行时、过去完成进行时

eg. I thought he was nice\ he had come back.\ he would come back.\ he was working hard. \he had been working hard.\ he will come back. -F \ he has been working hard. -F

c. 从属从句表示真理时，无论主句是过去、现在或将来时，该从句都用一般现在时

eg. They knew that the sun rises in the east.

We know that the sun rises in the east.

She will know that the sun rises in the east.



#### 15.for + 一段时间与完成时的关系

for\during\in\through\down through\over the past\last five years

= since five years ago



#### 16.since与完成时的关系

a. since表自从时，可作介词，之后接名词或动名词；since亦可作副词连词，之后接主语及动词，引导一般过去时的状语从句。无论since作介词或副词连词，所修饰的主句应用现在完成时或现在完成进行时，句型如下：

主语 + have/has + 过去分词 + since... 自从...以来就一直... 或

主语 + have/has been + 现在分词 + since...

eg. I have lived here since 2000.

b. since之后须接明确的某时间作宾语，不可接一段时间作宾语

eg. Peter has lived here since two years. -F( two years是一段时间)

Peter has lived here since 2002. -T(2002是明确的某时间)

c. since之后若有一段时间，则须在一段时间之后接ago

eg. Peter has lived here since two years ago.

 = Peter has lived here for two years.

d. 现在完成时或现在完成进行时的动词与for + 一段时间连用时。该动词所表示的动作必须可持续进行，否则就不可与for + 一段时间连用

eg. I have lived here for five years. -T

e. It is + 一段时间 + since

eg. It is three years since he died. -T

= Three years have passed since he died.



### 第二节、语态

#### 1.语态的种类

语态有两类，即主动语态及被动语态，形成被动语态时动词一定是及物动词

主动语态： I did(vt.) the work.

被动语态：The work was done by me.

注意：不及物动词只有主动语态，而无被动语态

eg. On the bed was lain by me. -F

= I lay on the bed.



#### 2.主动语态变成被动语态的方式

原句的宾语作主语，之后置be动词，再接过去分词

eg. Everyone(主语) loves(及物动词) him(宾语).

= He is loved by everyone.

| 时态   | 语态 | 主动语态              | 被动语态                       |
| ------ | ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 一般时 | 现在 | He done it.           | It is done by him.             |
|        | 过去 | He did it.            | It was done by him.            |
|        | 将来 | He will do it.        | It will be done by him.        |
| 完成时 | 现在 | He has done it.       | It has been done by him.       |
|        | 过去 | He had done it.       | It had been done by him.       |
|        | 将来 | He will have done it. | It will have been done by him. |
| 进行时 | 现在 | He is doing it.       | It is being done by him.       |
|        | 过去 | He was doing it.      | It was being done by him.      |
|        | 将来 | He will be doing it.  |                                |



#### 3.主动语态和被动语态时态要一致

eg. Everyone loves(一般现在时) him.

= He is loved by everyone.



#### 4.授予动词有两种被动语态

eg. I gave him a book.

= He was given a book by me.

= A book was given to him by me.



#### 5.动词 + 介词亦可变成被动语态

有些动词之后须与介词连用，形成短语动词，再置宾语时，要把动词 + 介词形成的短语动词视为及物动词，可变被动语态

eg. I was laughed by them. -F

= They laughed at me. -T

= I was laughed at by them. -T



#### 6.否定句的语态变化

eg. They do not love him.

= He is not loved by them.
