## 第十一章 代词

#### 1.it作形式主语

a. 代替不定式短语

eg. It is necessary to read these books.

= To read these books is necessary.

b. 代替that从句（名词性从句）

c. 代替动名词

eg. It is no use\no good reading novels all day long.

#### 2.即it作不完全及物动词之宾语，代替不定式短语或that从句

a. 动词若加宾语意思很完整，而无须补充说明时，叫做完全及物动词。

eg. I consider her beautifully.(adv.) -F

I consider her beautiful. -T

b.不定式或that从句有名词的功能，可作主语，亦可作宾语

eg. That he doesn't study(主语) is true.

但两者却不能直接作不完全及物动词之宾语，必须用it代替。

eg. I think that he is good true. -F

I think(不完全vt.) it true that he is good. -T think译成 认为...是...

I think(that)(完全vt.) it is true that he is good.名词性从句作think的宾语 think译成认为

以下是常用的不完全及物动词

think\consider\deem\believe\find 认为\认为\认为\相信\发现...是...
