## 第十章 比较结构

### 概说

比较结构要靠两种副词连词形成：than、as

基本句型有两种：

1.原级比较：as

eg. He is as(副词) diligent as(副词连词) Peter.

2.一般比较：than

eg. He is more diligent than Peter.



### 第一节、一般比较结构

一般比较结构，一定要使用副词连词than

#### 1.造句方式

a. 先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子

eg. He is prudent(adj.).

b. 再将句中形容词或副词变成比较级，即

more + adj. 比较...

less + adv. 比较不...

eg. He is more prudent.

c. 再设定比较对象，并在该比较对象之前置副词连词than，即告完成

eg. He is more prudent than Peter(比较对象).



#### 2.理论基础

than之后原本非单一的比较对象，而是与主句结构完全相同的状语从句。该状语从句修饰主句中的比较副词more或less

eg. He(S) is(be) more(比较副词) prudent(adj.) than(副词连词) Peter(S) is(be) prudent(adj.).

He(S) works(vi.) less(比较副词) enthusiasitcally(adv.) than(副词连词) Peter(S) works(vi.) enthusiastically(adv.).

为了避免重复，than引导的状语从句结构中仅保留比较对象，相同的陈述部分（即动词及动词以后的词）均予以省略，而成：

eg. He is more prudent than Peter.

He works less enthusiastically than Peter.



#### 3.than引导的状语从句结构变化

than引导的状语从句结构中，若有be动词，可将其保留；若有助动词(can、will、shall、have、has)亦可保留;若有一般动词，则应以do、does、did代替。当然这些be动词、助动词或do、does、did均予以省略。

a. be动词

eg. He is less responsible than you(are).

b.助动词

eg. He can sing more beautifully than you(can).

c.一般动词

eg. He worked more carefully than you(did).



#### 4.形容词及副词的比较级

绝大多数的副词或形容词，特别是三音节以上的副词或形容词，被more修饰时，均保留原级形态，但双音节的副词或形容词则是不规则变化，或改变词尾，或用more修饰，至于单音节的形容词和副词则几乎都采用词尾变化，而甚少用more修饰



#### 5.less之后的副词或形容词均使用原级

eg. He is less hardworking than John.



#### 6.与本身作比较

比较结构中通常比较对象是不同的人或物，但亦有与自己作比较的情形发生

eg. He studies harder than he did before.

a. 自行做比较时，句中的时态若不同，即主句为一般现在时，than从句为一般过去时，则than之后的主语以及其后之一般过去时be动词、助动词或一般动词变成的did不可省略。

1) be动词

eg. He is healthier than he was.

2) 助动词

eg. He can sing better than he could.

3) 一般动词

eg. He works harder than he did.

= He works harder than he used to.

b. 此类不同时态的自身比较结构中，若主句及than从句均有对等的介词短语，或than从句有另一when引导的状语从句修饰时，than之后的主语及动词或助动词部分可以省略。

1) 介词短语

eg. He is happier with Mary than he is (happy) with Jane.

= He is happier with Mary than with Jane.

注意：介词短语对称时，第二个短语中的介词千万不可省略，否则会造成对象的错误比较。

2) when从句

eg. He is much thinner than (he was) when I saw him ten years ago(状语从句).

He is much thinner than when I saw him ten years ago.



#### 7.比较结构中相同动词的化简

比较结构中，若主句为主语 + 及物动词 + 宾语，而than从句亦为主语 + 及物动词 + 宾语，且两个及物动词均相同时，than从句的动词可用do、does、did取代

eg. I love you more than he loves you.

= I love you more than he does you.



#### 8.数量形容词的比较级变化

数量形容词much、little、many、few变成比较级时，有下列变化

a. much及little修饰不可数名词

b. many及few很少的修饰可数的复数名词



#### 9.避免错误比较

主语 + 介词短语或所有格 + 主语极易形成对象的错误比较，应予避免

eg. The apples(主语) in this basket(介词短语) are sweeter than the table. -F

The apples(主语) in this basket(介词短语) are sweater than those(主语) on the table(介词短语). -T

注意：使用that或those作代词时，that代替单数名词或不可数名词，those则代替复数名词

eg. I have found that John's interest in English is greater than that of his classmate Jim.



#### 10.本身已有最高级意味的形容词

有些形容词本身就有至极或最高级的意味，不能使用在比较级结构中。这些词常用的有perfect完美的、sublime卓越的、noble高贵的、extreme极度的、superb极好的、excellent特优的

eg. He speaks English more perfectly than John. -F



#### 11.本身已有比较级意味的形容词

be superior to... 比...优越的

be inferior to... 比...差劲的

be senior to... 比...年长的；比...地位高的/资深的

be junior to... 比...年轻的；比...地位低的/资浅的

eg. I really doubt John's competence; it seems quite obvious that he is inferior to his friend David. 

类似的词类：

prior to + n. 在...之前(指时间)

= before + n.

eg. Prior to the war, he was a teacher.



#### 12.注意同范围及不同范围的比较

a. 同范围

某人或某物属于同一团体或种类，写作者欲将之与该团体或种类的其他所有份子作比较时，采用下列句型，以避免将该人或该物形成重叠比较

人：John is better than any other student in his class(同范围).
物：Tokyo is bigger than any other city in Japan(同范围).

b.不同范围

写作者欲将某人或某物与不同的团体或种类的所有份子做比较时，any或all之后无需加other一词。

人：John is better than any student in Mary's class(不同范围).

物：Shanghai is bigger than any city in Nepal(不同范围).



#### 13.be getting more and more + adj. 变得越来越...

= be getting 比较级adj. + and + 比较级 adj.

= be getting increasingly + adj.

eg. Life over there is getting more and more difficult.



#### 14.修饰比较级的副词

用来修饰比较级副词或形容词的有以下六个副词，置于被修饰的副词或形容词之前：

far、much、a lot、a great deal、still、even

eg. This question is far more difficult than that one.

a. 上列六个副词中，以far、much及a lot最常用，亦可用以修饰superior、inferior、senior、junior

eg. This car is far superior to that one

b. far much及a lot亦可修饰副词too

eg. He is far too old to do the work.



#### 15.最高级副词

最高级副词有两个：most及least，可用以修饰句中的形容词、副词或动词

a. 形容词

eg. She is the most beautiful girl(that) I've ever seen.

b. 副词

eg. He treats people most politely.

c.动词

eg. I need you most.



#### 16.最高级的比较对象一定是三者以上

使用最高级副词或形容词所形成的比较对象一定是三者或以上，通常出现在下列两个结构中

a. of\among... 在...个之中

b. 最高级形容词 + n. + 关系代词that（不可使用who、whom、which）+ 定语从句完成时

eg. John is the most responsible(最高级adj.) man (that) I've ever known(定语从句完成时).



#### 17.the 与最高级的关系

最高级副词修饰动词或副词时，不一定要加定冠词the，但最高级形容词修饰名词时，则须加the

a. 副词

eg. Of the four students, he treats people (the) most politely(adv.).

b. 动词

eg. Of all the people I know, I respect(vt.) him (the) most(最高级adv.)

c. 名词
eg. He is the best(最高级adj.) student(n.) of all.



#### 18.the + 最高级形容词

最高级形容词修饰名词时，前面因为加了定冠词the，而the + adj.可作代词用，故之后的名词可省略

eg. She is the most beautiful(adj.) girl(n.) of all.



#### 19.最高级的结构代换

eg. He is the best student of all.

= No one else is better than he. 他是所有学生中最好的一个。



#### 20.most亦可作very解：

加形容词修饰名词时，不必于most之前加定冠词

eg. She is really a most beautiful girl.



#### 21.by far可修饰最高级

带有the的最高级副词或形容词，可被by far及much两个副词修饰，其中以by far较为常用

eg. She is by far the most beautiful girl in town.她是镇上最美的女孩子



### 第二节、原级比较结构

原级比较结构出现在含有as...as...（和...一样地...）的结构中

#### 1.造句方式

a. 先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子

eg. He is prudent.

b. 再于句中的形容词或副词之前置as一词；as为副词，译成一样地

eg. He runs as(adv.) fast(adv.).

c. 再设定比较对象，并在该比较对象之前置副词连词as即告完成；此as译成和

eg. He is as(一样地) prudent as(和) John.



#### 2.理论基础

第二个as为副词连词，之后应有一个与主句完全一样的结构，即as引导的状语从句，修饰第一个as，此为副词，表一样地

即：He(S) is(be) as prudent(adj.) as John(S) is(be) prudent(adj.).



#### 3.as从句的变化

a. be动词

eg. He is as prudent as John.

b. 助动词

eg. He can sing as well as John.

c. 一般动词

eg. He runs as fast as John.



#### 4.as从句或than从句亦可采用倒装结构

这种倒装结构常出现在as从句或than从句之后有定语从句时

eg. He is as prudent as John is, who is a good friend of mine. （-F, who之前先行词John）

He is as prudent as is John, who is a good friend of mine. -T



#### 5.as...as...用于肯定句或否定句，而so...so...则只用于否定句

肯定句：He studies so hard as Mary. -F

He studies as hard as Mary. -T

否定句：He doesn't study as hard as Mary. -T



### 第三节、其他有关as/than的重要用法

1.as...as可与单数可数名词连用

造句方法：

a. 先造一个含有形容词的单数可数名词的句子；

eg. He is a handsome(adj.) boy(n.).

b. 再将第一个as置于动词之后

eg. He is as a handsome boy. -F

由于as是副词，并非修饰不定冠词a，故须将形容词handsome与a互换位置，使handsome紧接as之后，以供其修饰

即：He is as handsome a boy. -T

c. 再将第二个as置于 a boy之后，然后接比较对象，即告完成

eg. He is as handsome a boy as John.

注意：
1）类似此种只能与单数名词连用的结构尚有

so...that... 如此...以致/所以...

too...to... 太...而不...

how... 多么地

a) so...that...

eg. He is so good a boy that I like him very much.

= He is such a good boy that I like him very much.

b) too...to...

eg. He is too old a man to do it.

c) how...

eg. How great a man he is!

= What a great man he is!

2）what与such之后可修饰单复数或不可数名词

eg. What a great man he is!



#### 2.as...as one can = as...as possible 尽可能地

a.造句方法：

1）先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子

eg. You must study hard(adv.).

2）在hard或quiet之前置入第一个as(作副词，译为一样地)

eg. You must study as hard. He ramained as quiet.

3）句尾添入as one can或possible，即告完成

eg. You should study as hard as you can.

b. 理论基础

1) as one can之后省略了与前面主句中相同的部分，以避免赘述。

eg. You must study as hard as you can study hard.= You must study as hard as you can. -T

2) as possible系为as it is/was possible化简而成，it是代词，代替前面相同的部分

eg. You must study as hard as it is possible.

= You must study as hard as studying hard(动名词作主语) is possible.



#### 3.as...as any 与任何人一样...

eg. He is as happy a man as any.



#### 4.as...as ever 与往常一样...

eg. Though it has been a long time since I parted from him, he is as young as ever.



#### 5.as...as ever lived 古今最...之一

= one of the + 最高级... that ever lived

eg. He is as great a hero as ever lived.

= He is one of the greatest heros that ever lived.



#### 6.两个形容词的相互比较

more...than结构中，若为两个形容词相互比较，则此两个形容词一律使用原级

eg. He is more good than bad.

= He is not so bad as good. = He is good rather than bad. 他好的成分大过坏的成分。



#### 7.倍数词造句法

a. 本结构一共有四种：

1) 倍数词 + as...as... 是...的几倍

2）more than + 倍数词 + as...as... 是...的几倍还不止

3）倍数词 + the (或所有格) + 名词 是...的几倍

4）more than + 倍数词 + the(或所有格) + 名词 是...的几倍还不止

b. 倍数词 + as...as... 是...的几倍

eg. I am three times as old as he.

c. more than + 倍数词 + as...as... 是...的几倍还不止

eg. He studies more than three times as hard as I. 他的用功是我的三倍还不止。

注意：

more than + 倍数词 + as...as... = 倍数词 + more...than...

eg. He is more than three times as diligent as I.

= He is three times more diligent than I.

d. 倍数词 + the\that\his\those\these\所有格 + 名词 是...的几倍

eg. The river is ten times the length of the Tamsui River.

= The river is ten times as long as the Tamsui River.

e. more than + 倍数词 + the(或所有格) + 名词 是...的几倍还不止

eg. The river is ten times as long as the Tamsui River.

f. 下列词类均可视为倍数词

one-third\two-fifth\twice 二倍

eg. I am half as old as you. 我的年龄只有你的一半。

g.特殊结构

1）twice as...as...(常用) 是...的两倍

= as...again as... (少用)

eg. He is twice as old as I.

= He is as old again as I.

2）one and a half times as...as... (常用)

= half as...again as... (少用) 是...的一倍半

eg. He is eight years old, and I am one and a half times as old as he.

3) as many as + 数词 + 复数名词 多达...

eg. As many as one hundred people were killed in the air crash.

as much as + 金钱名词

as long as\as wide as\as high as\as early as\as late as + 数词 + 名词 长达\宽达\高达\早在\迟至

eg. I have been learning English for as long as 25 years.



#### 8.not so much...as... 与其说是...倒不如说是...

not so much as... 甚至都不...

a. 表与其说是...倒不如说是...，共有四种用法

1) be not so + adj.\adv. + as adj.\adv.

由于原级形容词或副词不能以much修饰，故不可用not so much + adj.\adv. + as，而要用not so + adj.\adv. + as的结构

eg. She is not so beautiful as charming.= She is charming rather than beautiful. 与其说她美，不如说她迷人。

2) be not so much + n. + as + n.

eg. He is not so much a writer as a scholar.

= He is more of a scholar than a writer. 与其说他是个作家，不如说他是个学者

3) not so much + 介词短语\不定式短语 + as + 介词短语\不定式短语

eg. Success lies not so much in luck(介词短语) as in hard work(介词短语).

= Success lies more in hard work than luck. 与其说成功在于运气，不如说在于辛勤努力。

4) not so much + 动词 + as + 动词

eg. The oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it.

= The oceans do not divide the world so much as unite it.

= The oceans unite the world more than they divide it. 与其说是海洋分割这个世界，不如说是统合这个世界。

b. not so much as... = not even... 甚至都不...

注意：使用本短语时，要置于助动词之后，即：

cannot so much as + 原形动词 甚至...都不能...

do not so much as + 原形动词 甚至...都不...

have not so much as + 过去分词 甚至...都没有...

eg. He has not so much as written a single word yet.

= He has not even written a single word yet. 他甚至连半个字都还没写

注意：介词without之后亦可采用类似短语，即

without so much as + V-ing 连...都没有

= without even + V-ing

eg. He went away without so much as saying goodbye.

= He went away without even saying goodbye. 



#### 9.the + 比较级..., the + 比较级 越...就越...

a. 句型分析

eg. The older he grew, the weaker his memory became. 他越老，记忆力就越差。

b. 越...就越...的造句法

由于The..., the...均为副词，故使用本句型的先决条件为：句中要有副词或形容词

公式：

1) 加The , the;

2) 造句子；

3）在空格之后填上句子;

4) 副词或形容词往前移入空格中；若形容词之后有名词，也往前移，但名词若有冠词则要删除

eg. The harder you study, the better student you'll become. -T

c. 使用越...就越...的结构时，要注意两点：

1）若句中无副词或形容词，则在The 或the之后置副词more 或less。

eg. The more you love me, the nicer I'll be to you. -T

2）若句中的主语为一般名词，而非代词或专有名词，且后面的动词为be动词时，该be动词可省略

eg. The better the boy is, the more I like him. -T

d. 比较级 + and + 比较级 越来越...

eg. It is getting warmer and warmer every year.

e. all the + 比较级 + for + N\becuase 从句

即令...却更加...;就是因为...却更加...

本短语中的for为介词，之后接名词作宾语。because则为副词连词，引导状语从句。for及because原本表因为，但在词句型中，译成即使或即令。

eg. She is beautiful.

= She is all the more beautiful for her shabby clothing.

= She is all the more beautiful because her clothing is shabby.

即使她的衣着褴褛，她却显得更加美丽。/就因为她的衣着褴褛，她显得更加美丽。

f. none the + 比较级 + for + N\because 从句 即使...却一点也不...

eg. His health is not good.

= His health is none the better for his exercise.

= His health is none the better because he exercises.

g. none the less + adj\adv. + for + N\because从句 即使...却仍然

none the less 为副词，原意为一点也不少，译成仍然，可修饰动词、形容词或副词

1) 修饰动词，置于该动词之后。

eg. I love及物动词 him none the less because he is poor.

2) 修饰形容词，置于该形容词之前。

eg. She is none the less beautiful for he shabby clothing.

3) 修饰副词，置于该副词之前

eg. He studied none the less hard because he had failed the exam.



#### 10. no more...than...\no less...than...;

no more...than... ...不是...正如...不是...

no less...than... 和...一样...

a. 此类结构一共有四种：

1) no more...than... ...不是...正如...不是...

eg. He is no more a student than I am.

2) no less...than... 和...一样...

eg. He is no less good at English than John.

3) not more...than... 没有比...要...

eg. She is not more beautiful than Mary.

4) not less...than... 至少与...一样...

eg. She is not less beautiful than Mary.

b. no more...than... ...不是...正如...不是...

eg. He  cannot sing, just as I cannot sing.

= He cannot sing any more than I (can).

= He can no more sing than I (can).

c. no less...than...=as...as... 和...一样...

由于no less...than...就等于as...as...，故no less之后可置副词或形容词以供修饰】

1) 副词

eg. He studies no less hard than John.

= He studies as hard as John.

2) 形容词

eg. He is no less good at English than John.

= He is as good at English as John.

d. not more...than... 没有比...更多...

= at best as...as... 最多只是和...一样...

eg. She is more beautiful than Mary.

= She is not more beautiful than Mary.

= She is at best as beautiful as Mary. 她不比玛丽美丽，顶多只是和玛丽一样美

e. not less than... 没有比...更少...

= at least as...as... 至少与...一样

eg. She is not less beautiful than Mary.

= She is at least as beautiful as Mary. 她至少和玛丽一样美

f. 整理本单元句型如下：

eg. He can no more drive than I.

= He cannot drive any more than I.

= He cannot drive, just as I cannot drive. 他不会开车，就如我一样。——两人都不会开车

He is no less handsome than I.

= He is as handsome as I. 他和我一样英俊。

He is not more handsome than I.

= He is at best as handsome as I. 他不比我英俊，顶多和我一样。

He is not less handsome than I.

= He is at least as handsome as I. 他至少跟我一样英俊。



#### 11.no more than...\no less than...:

no more than + 数词 = not more than + 数词 最多不超过...

no less than + 数词 至少\不少于

a. no more than(adv.) + 数词(adj.) + N 最多不超过...

= at most + 数词 + N

eg. It takes no more than ten minutes to get there on foot.

b. not more than(adv.) + 数词(adj.) + N = at most + 数词 + N 最多不超过...

eg. I'll stay here not more than three days.

= I'll stay here no more than three days. 我在词停留的时间最多不超过3天。

c. no less than(adv.) + 数词(adj.) + N 至少\不少于...

= as least + 数词 + N

eg. No less than seventy thousand people attended the concert.

= At least seventy thousand people attended the concert.



#### 12.at most\at best

a. at most\not more than + 数词 最多不超过

eg. He is at most ten years old.

b. at best...充齐量\只不过是...

= nothing but...
